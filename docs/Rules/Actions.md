1. The player nominates a formation
2. Declare the action you will take
3. Attempt to pass an action test

Only [[Broken Formations|unbroken]] formations may perform an action

### Action Test
- Roll D6 >= Initiative rating of the [[Formation]]
	- -1 IF
		- formation has any blast markers
		- or if attempting to [[Retain the Initiative]]
- IF failed 
	- The [[Formation]] receives a [[Blast Markers|blast maker]]
	- you must take a [[Actions#Hold|hold]] action

OR
- [[Movement|move]] once then [[Regroup]]

### Overwatch

### FAQ
- if one player runs out the other player continues until all formations are done
- if you try to retain the [[Initiative]] and have a [[Blast Markers|blast maker]] then it is a -2 to your action test
- Action test rolls of 1 is not a automatic failure 
- You cannot [[Retain the Initiative]] if you fail an action test
