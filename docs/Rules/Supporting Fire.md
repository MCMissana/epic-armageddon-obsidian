### FAQ
- Supporting fire is not affected by [[Suppression]]
- Hits from supporting fire do not carry over to units that were not directly involved
- Directly involved is checked and re-evaluated at the end of every round. In a three round assault a unit can go from directly involved, to not and back again with [[counter charge]] moves and units being removed
