### Rallying Formations

- In the End, phase both players take turns to rally formations that have [[Blast Markers]] or that are [[Broken Formations|broken]]. Rally the formations one at a time, starting with the player with the higher strategy rating. In order to rally a formation you must roll equal to or over the formationâ€™s initiative value on a D6

### Rally Test Modifiers
Condition | modifier
------------ | ------------
Formation is broken|  -2
Enemy units within 30cm	| -1
Note modifiers are cumulative

### If the test is failed
- If the formation is [[Broken Formations|broken]] it must make a [[Broken Formations#Withdrawal Move|withdrawal]]
- Formations that are unbroken must remain in place but may not remove any [[Blast Markers]]

### If the test is passed 
- Remove half the Blast markers from the formation, rounding fractions up.
- Formations with one Blast marker remaining that pass a Rally test remove the last Blast marker. 
- A broken formation that rallies is no longer broken. 
	- It counts as having as many Blast markers as units, half of which will be removed for passing the Rally test. 
	- For example, a broken formation with seven units that rallied would no longer be broken and would receive three Blast markers.
