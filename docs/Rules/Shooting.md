Shooting happens in the action phase

Formations may not spit fire
- All attacks must be at one target formation

### Procedure
1. Place a [[Blast Markers|blast marker]] on target formation
2. Roll to hit
	- A natural roll of 1 is always failed
	- -1 to hit if
		-  [[Actions#Double|double]] or [[Actions#Marshall|marshall]] action
		- Target is in [[Terrain#Cover|cover]]
			- If a formation has a mix of units in and out of cover. either shoot all at -1, or shoot just those out of cover to ignore the -1
	- +1 to hit if
		- [[Actions#Sustained fire|sustained fire]] action
1. Allocate hits
	1. allocated from front to back
		1. AP hits: infantry only
		2. AT hits: Armour Vehicles only
	1. No unit can have a 2nd hit until all potential targets have one hit
2. make saving throws and remove causalities
	1. Use Armour value on data sheet ***or*** [[Terrain#Cover Save|cove save]]
	2. make 1 save per hit suffered
3. Place additional [[Blast Markers]] for casualties and check to see if the enemy formation is [[Broken Formations|broken]]
	1. Note this is after shooting is resolved and after units are removed

### Macro Weapons
- A weapon unaffected by armour saves
- if normal hits and macro weapon hits are scored
	1. Apply normal hits
	2. Make saves for normal hits
	3. Apply macro weapon hits
- In [[Assault]] any unit in 15cms can be hit by a Macro weapon attack regardless of where it is from a CC or FF attack

### Who can shoot
- a unit must be in range
- must have line of fire to at least one unit in the target formation
- must not be [[Suppression|suppressed]]

### Suppressed Units
- Each blast marker results in one unit that is ***in range*** and ***in line of fire*** that cannot shoot
- Allocated from the back to the front
-  units without a range weapon cannot be suppressed
	- units with only small arms may only be suppressed if they are within 15cm and have line of fire

### Allocating Hits
- Hits are allocated from front to back
- Line of fire is required to allocate a hit

### Terrain
- if a unit is within 10cm of a piece of terrain then they cannot be seen
	- exp. deep in woods

### Firing Arcs
- Weapons have a 360 degree line of fire if not specified
- FFA
	- 180 degree in front
- RFA
	- 180 degree behind
- LFR OR RFA
	- 180 degrees to the left or right
- FFFA
	- 90 degrees in front

### 7+ to Hit
- Note this only applies to Hit rolls, NOT for armour saves etc.
1. roll a D6 and it must result in a 6
2. roll a second D6
	- 7+ => 4+ 
	- 8+ => 5+
	- 9+ => 6+
	- 10+ => impossible


### FAQ
- A formation armed with only AP can fire at an AT formation even though it cannot damage it just for the intent of causing a blast marker. This holds for AT against INF as well
- A unit armed with two or more of the same kind of weapon can choose to fire some with their AP value and other with the AT value
	- ***HOWEVER*** A unit armed with a weapon that has multiple shots cannot split its fire between AT and AP
