 ### War Engines

### Damage Capacity
- How many hits a war engine can take before being destroyed
- Hits against a war engine are hits that reduced the damage capacity

### Critical hits
- Roll a critical hit roll for every hit that reduced the war engines damage capacity
- if a critical hit causes additional hits, roll critical hit rolls for these
- if a critical hits effect is resolved in the end phase and its effect causes an additional critical hit, then resolve that in the next end phase

### Blast Markers
- Every time a war engine loses a point of damage it receives one [[Blast Markers]]
- if destroyed by a critical affect then its formation receives blast marks equal to its remaining damage capacity
- [[Blast Markers]] equal to its starting damage capacity are required to [[Broken Formations|break]] it
	- add the war engines starting damage capacity when calculating the break point of a formation

### Assaulting War Engines
- War engines can barge enemy units when it charges into [[Assault]]
	- move the war engine as far as desired and then place barged units as clos to starting positions as possible in base contact with the war engine
	- Cannot barge War engines
	- max 2xDC units can be barged
- Roll a number of dice for attacks equal to starting damage capacity 
	- can be split between CC and FF
- When working out the results in an Assault count each point of damage inflicted against the war engines as a single causality
- for outnumbering the war engine counts for as many units as its starting DC
- if a war engine loses an assault it takes an extra point of damage for each point it lost by

### War engine Withdrawals
- after making a withdrawal move if there are any enemy units within 15cm then the War Engine suffers one extra point of damage(no save) for every enemy unit within 15cm

### Coherency
- Starting [[War Engines#Damage Capacity|DC]] \* 5cm

### Zone of Control
- War engines lose their [[Zone of Control]] in an [[Assault]] when in base contact with as many units as their starting damage capacity

### Transport War Engines
- Can transport units from another formation
	- must be able to transport the entire formation
- follows normal [[Transports|transport]] rules
- Units embarking on the war engine must be able to move into contact with it during their action
- The war engine can take an action before this but cannot take an action after the unit have mounted up
- units disembarking cannot take an action in the turn they disembark but can shoot or assault when disembarking if the war engine was able to 

### Barrage against a War engine
- Any War Engine targeted by a template such as a [[Barrage]] and it is directly under the center of the template it takes attacks equal to half its starting Damage Capacity
- For placing a template a war engine counts as a number of units equal to its starting damage capacity
- Multiple templates do not cause additional hits
