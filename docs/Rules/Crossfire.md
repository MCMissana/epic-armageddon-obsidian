### Crossfire
> Formations that take fire from the flank or rear are caught in a  
deadly crossfire, and will suffer additional casualties as troops  
struggle to find cover from attacks coming from an unexpected  
direction.

- You can claim the crossfire bonus if 
	- you can draw a straight line up to 45cm long from any of the units in the shooting formation to any unit in another friendly formation 
	- and this line crosses a unit from the target formation or the gap between two units  from the target formation.
- The friendly unit that the crossfire line is drawn to must have a line of fire to a unit from the target formation, but does not have to be in range with any of its weapons. You may not use units that are in [[Broken Formations|broken]] or [[Actions#March|marching]] formations to claim the crossfire bonus.

- All units from a formation caught in a crossfire suffer a -1 save modifier
- A formation caught in a crossfire attack receives two [[Blast Markers]] for the first unit destroyed by the attack

- Some [[Terrain]] features or special rules may counter this modifier
