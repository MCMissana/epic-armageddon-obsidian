### Zone of Control
- each unit has a zone of control of 5cm around them

- A unit that has enemies within its zone of control loses its zone of control.

- The only way to enter a units zone of control is through an [[Actions#Engage|engage action]]/[[Assault#Charge moves|charge move]]
	- If you are in an enemies zone of control you must either engage it or take an action that will allow you to leave the zone of control when you next activate the unit
