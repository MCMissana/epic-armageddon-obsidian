### Assault
- Formations that do an [[Actions#Engage|engage action]] are allowed to move and then fight and assault, these are base to base and small arms fire
- You must take an [[Actions#Engage|engage action]] in order to trigger an assault, even if units are <15cm apart
- Kills inflicted in assault do not place [[Blast Markers]] or [[Broken Formations|break units]] until the results have been resolved

### Assault Procedure
1. Choose a target formation
	1. You may choose two or more formations as a target see [[Assault#Intermingled formations|Intermingled]]
2. Make a charge move
	1. [[Actions#Engage|Engage action]]
	2. Once the move is complete at least one unit must be within 15cm of the target formation or no assault occurs
	3. Note this may trigger overwatch resolve before counter charge
3. Make counter charges
	1. You do not need to counter charge
	2. Only can be made with units not currently in base to base contact with the enemy
	3. Must move directly towards the closest enemy
	4. Counter charge move length
		- If move <=25cm then a 5cm counter charge
		- If move >=30cm then a 10cm counter charge
5. Resolve attacks
	1. CC is used for base to base, FF is used within 15cm
		- units without FF it can only fight in base to base contact
	2. Roll 1D6 for each unit attacking
		- ignore suppression during an assault
		- ***No modifiers*** ever apply in assault
	3. Allocate hits as you would in [[Shooting#Allocating Hits|shooting]]
		- Hits can only be allocated to units directly involved in the assault
	4. Make saves
		-  Infantry making the charge cannot benefit from [[Terrain#Cover|cover]] but the defending [[Terrain#Cover Save|can]]
	5. Check if assault is finished
		1.  If all defenders are killed and at least one attacker lives the the assault is over
			- skip to step 7
		2. If all "directly engaged" attackers are killed then the assault has stalled and the defender wins
			- skip to step 7
		3. If at least one attacker survives, both sides can [[Supporting Fire|call on supporting fire]]
6. Work out results
	- If one side completely wiped out the other side, then it wins automatically
	- otherwise both players roll 2D6 
		1. Select higher Die
		2. Add any modifiers
			- +1 for each kill during the assault
			- +1 if you have more units than the opposing formation
			- +1 if you have twice as many units. ***NOT*** including [[Supporting Fire|supporting formations]]
			- +1 if your formation has no [[Blast Markers]]
			- +1 if the opposing formation has more [[Blast Markers]]
		3. The highest score wins
	- The loser suffers [[Assault#Extra Hits|extra hits]] equal to  the difference, 
7. Loser withdraws 
	1. The loser is broken, if already broken they will be destroyed instead
	2. Make a Withdrawal move
	3. Any formations on the losing side that were within 15cm suffer a [[Blast Markers|blast marker]]
8. Winner consolidates
	1. Receives one [[Blast Markers|blast marker]] for any causalities sustained
		- If the winner is now broken they can make a Withdrawal move
	2. If the winner was broken before combat they receive no additional [[Blast Markers]]
	3. Units can make a 5cm consolidation move, cannot enter an enemies [[Zone of Control]]

### Special rules for the first stage of an assault
- An attacker must kill all defenders to win at this stage before support is called
- The defender just has to kill all attackers that are [[Assault#Directly Engaged|directly engaged]] to win at this stage

### Charge moves
- Only way to enter a units [[Zone of Control]]
- base to base contact allows units to use their CC value instead of FF
- You cant enter the [[Zone of Control]] of a unit that was not targeted
- a maximum of **two** units can move into base contact with each defender
- once a charging unit enters an enemies [[Zone of Control]] it must move into base contact with the closet enemy whos zone it entered
	- Once an enemy has been contacted it loses its [[Zone of Control]] for the rest of the assault and other units can move past it
- Only one unit must be within 15cm for the assault to occur

### Counter Charge
-  All charge move rules apply
- If the closest enemy unit is in contact with two defending units it can counter charge the next closest enemy
- If a [[Transports|transport]] counter charges the troops inside can [[Transports#Disembarking|disembark]], as long as the transport is not in base to base contact with two enemy units
	- The units are placed within 5cm of the transport
-  If the closest enemy during a counter charge is not in the charging formation you still are required to counter charge that enemy. This will drag that formation into the assault
	- treat them as a single formation with original unit for the assault
- A formation that uses its [[Overwatch]] can still counter charge


#### Directly Engaged
- being within 15cm of an enemy after all [[Assault#Charge moves|charge moves]] and [[Assault#Counter Charge|counter charge moves]] have been made

#### Extra Hits
- allocated to base contact first then closest enemy. 
- ***No Saves taken against these hits*** 
- does not require [[Assault#Directly Engaged|directly involved]] and can include units in a different formation
- Transports
	- Once one of these hits is allocated to a transport(or it is skipped over due to [[Data Sheet Overview#Fearless|fearless]]) all units it is transporting must be allocated a hit(while any remain) before moving on to the next closest
	- Any units remaining that were being transported([[Data Sheet Overview|fearless]] units, or those who were not allocated a hit) would then make their normal armour save or a 6+ [[Terrain#Cover Save|cover save]] if the transport was destroyed, the formation would not receive [[Blast Markers]] for any of these saves if failed

#### Intermingled formations
- Formations that are with 5cm of each other
- As an attacker you do not need to include intermingled formations as a target of a charge
- intermingled formations count as one formation
	- all can counter charge
	- all can be [[Shooting#Allocating Hits|allocated hits]]
	- total of all blast markers
	- if they lose all formations are broken 
	- if they win all defenders receive [[Blast Markers]] for casualties and can perform a consolidate move

### FAQ
- If in the second round of an assault and no units are within 15cm after both sides counter charge then work out the result again
- -1 to hit from cover is not applied during an assault
- Weapons that have special rules should be allocated in such a way that utilize their special rules.
	- Exp. a weapon that ignores cover should be allocated to a unit that can make a cover save
- [[Crossfire]] bonuses are not applied in assaults
- a unit needs line of fire to be considered directly engaged
- If after working out the results of an assault it is tied
	- Both sides can make another counter charge move starting with the attacker
	- Resolve another round of attacks
	- Casualties from the first round are still counter towards modifiers in the second round
- A [[Transports|transport]] may pick up a unit as part of its consolidation move although the unit being picked up may not make a consolidation move
- since consolidation moves are optional a [[Data Sheet Overview#Fearless|fearless]] unit could remain in a units [[Zone of Control]] causing the formations to be automatically drawn in to an assault
	- This assumes right away and not in the next activation
