## Epic Tournament Game Rules

The Epic tournament game rules are designed to be used in conjunction with the Epic tournament army lists. They will allow two players to fight an evenly balanced battle with little or no preparation. They are ideal for pick-up games at clubs or shows, and provide an evenly balanced contest in tournaments.

In many ways, tournament games represent the most basic form of game play, and are designed to be as easy and accessible as possible in order to allow Epic players to play games with the minimum of fuss. Because of this, the tournament rules require little or no preparation other than picking forces from the army lists, while the army lists are designed to work with the packaged range of Epic miniatures produced by Games Workshop, making it easy for players to put together an army. Later sections include rather more advanced rules and guidelines that will allow experienced players to design their own unique formations and units for use in scenarios or campaigns of their own devising.

### Forces

Both players pick armies to an agreed points total between 2,000 to 5,000 points using the tournament army lists. It is possible to play games using the tournament rules for larger or smaller games than this, but please note that the army lists have been balanced assuming that armies will fall within this range, and this means that larger or smaller games may be slightly unbalanced.


### Set-up

Set up the terrain for the game in any mutually agreeable manner. If one player sets up the terrain then his opponent may choose where to deploy. If you set up the terrain as a joint effort or it was set up by a tournament organiser then the player with the higher strategy rating may choose the table edge he sets up on. If both players have the same strategy rating, then dice to see who gets the choice of table edge. You can pick a long edge, or a corner (half way up each long and short edge). The opponent sets up on the opposite edge or corner.

The tournament game rules have been designed to be played on tables that are 90–150cm wide by 150–240cm long (that’s 3–5 feet by 5–8 feet for you non-metric types!) The ideal size is round-about 120cm by 180cm (4 feet by 6 feet). It is possible to play games on tables that are wider or longer than this, but this may favour certain armies and could lead to an unbalanced game.

### Tournament Terrain
The tournament game rules will work on any type of terrain. However, especially dense or extremely sparse terrain will favour some armies or troop choices over others. An Ork army with a lot of Boyz will do well on a table covered with lots of terrain, for example, while an Ork army with lots of buggies and gunwagons will do better on a table with sparse terrain. In addition, certain terrain features can favour one army over another. Having a river running the length of the table will favour an army with a lot of skimmers and aircraft. You get the idea, I’m sure.

Because of this, we recommend you use the following guidelines when setting up terrain for tournament games. These are not a set of hard and fast rules, but if they are used will ensure a well-balanced game no matter what army or units are taken.

-   We recommend the use of terrain features when playing tournament games in preference to modular terrain (see the Appendices for a more detailed description of the two types of terrain).
-   Terrain features can be of pretty much any type, but should be roughly 15–30cm across. Hills can be up to twice this size. See below for a note of how to deal with rivers and roads.
-   Divide the table into 60cm (2 foot) square areas. The total number of terrain features placed should be equal to twice the number of 60cm square areas. For example, if you were playing on a 120cm by 180 cm, you would have six areas and should place 12 terrain features.
-   Within the limits above, place between 0–4 features in each 60cm square.
-   The terrain may include one river. Rivers count as a terrain feature for each area that they run through. They need to enter on one table edge and leave from another, and should not be greater in length than the shortest table edge. For example, on a 120cm by 180cm table, the river should not be more than 120cm long. There should be a bridge or ford every 30cm along the river.
-   Roads may be added after all terrain features have been placed. Any number of roads may be used. They need to enter on one table edge and either exit from another or end at a terrain feature.

### Place objective markers
Take it in turns, starting with the player with the higher strategy rating, to place one objective marker on the table. If both players have the same strategy rating then dice to see who places the first objective marker.

The first objective a player sets up must be placed on their own table edge. The remaining two objectives must be set up in their opponent’s half of the table, at least 30cm away from the opponent’s table edge and 30cm away from any other objectives that have already been placed.

Keep placing objectives until six objective markers have been placed on the table in total. You can use anything as an objective marker but we would suggest using terrain pieces to represent them if you can. In our games, we’ve found that battling over an actual bunker or fuel dump is far more appealing than having your forces sell their lives for a cardboard counter!

You capture an objective if you have a unit within 15cms of it in the end phase and your opponent does not. An objective is contested if both sides have a unit within 15cms of it in the end phase. Units from broken formations or from formations that have rallied that end phase can not capture or contest objectives. Aircraft which have landed may not capture an objective on the same turn that it lands. However, a landed aircraft may immediately contest an objective.

Check at the end of each turn to see how many objectives you control. Objectives do not have a memory and you will lose control of any you have captured if there are no friendly units within 15cms of them at the end of any subsequent turn.

### Setup space craft and garrisons
If either player is using spacecraft then they are set up now before any other units (see [4.3](https://tp.net-armageddon.org/tournament-pack/#spacecraft)). Units entering play via planetfall should be placed to one side at this time too (see [4.4](https://tp.net-armageddon.org/tournament-pack/#planetfall)).

On-table garrison units are set up after spacecraft have been set up. The following types of formations may be set up on the table as garrisons at the start of the game:

-   Formations where half or more of the units (rounding up) are scouts or
-   Formations where no more than one of the units has a move greater than 15cms, and where none of the units are war engines or
-   Any formations that include units with a speed of 0 (zero).

Players take it in turns to set up one garrison at a time, starting with the player with the higher strategy rating. Garrisons must be set up so that they have at least one unit within 15cm of an objective in the player’s own half of the table. No units may be set up in the opponent’s half of the table or in impassable terrain. Units may be set up in dangerous terrain (it’s assumed that they took their time getting into position in order to do so safely!)

Each player may start up to two of their garrisoned formations on Overwatch. These formations represent sentries deployed as a trip wire and to provide security at the objectives. They are assumed to have gone on Overwatch in their previous Action phase. That Overwatch is carried over into the first turn.

### Setup remaining forces
All of the remaining formations in the players’ armies must be set up within 15cms of their own side’s table edge or be kept back in reserve. The players take it in turn to set up these formations one at a time, starting with the player with the higher strategy rating.

Units kept in reserve must either be aircraft, or be going to enter play in a transport aircraft or by teleportation. Reserve formations entering play in aircraft or by teleportation should be placed aside with units that will enter play via planetfall. These formations are not secret and your opponent may inspect them at any time.

Units being transported must start the game already loaded into the transport vehicle that will bring them into play (i.e., an aircraft or unit with the planetfall ability).

Formations entering play in aircraft or from spacecraft can do so on any turn, following the rules for transport aircraft and planetfall (see [4.2.5](https://tp.net-armageddon.org/tournament-pack/#transporting-ground-units) and [4.4](https://tp.net-armageddon.org/tournament-pack/#planetfall)). Formations that are in reserve may not carry out _any_ game functions or use special abilities they may have.

### Victory conditions
You must check to see if either player has won at the end of the third and fourth game turns. If neither player has won at the end of the fourth turn then the tiebreaker rule is used to determine the winner.

Each player is trying to achieve five things known as goals. You win if you have achieved two of these goals in the end phase of turns three or four, and you have achieved more goals than your opponent. The five goals are: _Blitzkrieg_, _Break Their Spirit_, _Defend The Flag_, _Take And Hold_, and _They Shall Not Pass_.

Blitzkrieg

You achieve this goal by capturing the objective that was set up on the opponent’s table edge at the start of the game (i.e., the first objective each player set up).

Break Their Spirit

You achieve this goal by destroying (not breaking) the formation worth the most points in the opposing army. If several formations are tied for the most points, you achieve this goal by destroying any one of them.

Defend To Flag

You achieve this goal if you control all three objectives in your half of the table.

Take And Hold

You achieve this goal by capturing a total of two objectives in your opponent’s half of the table.

They Shall Not Pass

You achieve this goal if there are no unbroken enemy formations in your half of the table.

If neither player has won at the end of the fourth or any subsequent turn then both players roll a D6 to see if the game carries on another turn or ends in a tiebreak. If both players roll the same number then the game carries on for another turn and the players must roll again at the end of the next turn to see if the game ends or carries on another turn, and so on.

If the players roll different numbers then the game ends in a tiebreak. Each player scores a number of _victory points_ equal to the full points value of any enemy formations that have been completely destroyed, plus the full points value of any enemy formations that are broken _and_ have been reduced to half strength or less, plus half the value of any formation reduced to half strength or less but is not broken, plus half the value of any formation that is broken but is above half strength. Whoever has the higher points score is the winner. For the purpose of this rule, a formation’s strength is equal to the number of units in the formation plus the (remaining) damage capacity of any war engines.
