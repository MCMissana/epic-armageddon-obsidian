	- 1: unit is destroyed
	- 2+: no affect
- The formation will not receive [[Blast Markers]] for units that fail the test

	- units in terrain where the terrain partially obscures them
	- Intervening terrain obscures the target unit partially from view

	- This cover save can be used instead of the units armour save. ***NOT BOTH
- Cover saves cannot be made by attackers in an [[Assault]]
- This is in addition to the -1 to hit modifier
