###  Make counter charges
1. You do not need to counter charge
2. Only can be made with units not currently in base to base contact with the enemy
3. Must move directly towards the closest enemy
4. Counter charge move length
	1. If move <=25cm then a 5cm counter charge
	2. If move >=30cm then a 10cm counter charge

### Counter Charge
-  All [[Assault#Charge moves|charge move]] rules apply
- If the closest enemy unit is in contact with two defending units it can counter charge the next closest enemy
- If a [[Transports|transport]] counter charges the troops inside can [[Transports#Disembarking|disembark]], as long as the transport is not in base to base contact with two enemy units
	- The units are placed within 5cm of the transport
-  If the closest enemy during a counter charge is not in the charging formation you still are required to counter charge that enemy. This will drag that formation into the assault
	- treat them as a single formation with original unit for the assault
- A formation that uses its [[Overwatch]] can still counter charge

###FAQ
- Q: After counter charges are made does the engaging formation need to have at least one unit with a line of fire to a unit in the target formation in order for the assault to take place?
	- In the first round of the assault yes, as all the normal charge rules apply. In subsequent rounds the assault is already taking place and its result must be determined
